# freecodecamp_chrome
This is a chrome plugin to make the fcc interface more intuitive and informative.

The learn.freecodecamp.com default login screen has the first section of the first certificate opened up. That is great when you are working on that section, but for the rest of your entire time on fcc you have to either scroll past that or close it and then open up whatever section you are working on in order to see the current lessons.

This plugin currently closes the first section, and in the future it will try to mark your completed sections and certificates in addition to opening up the farthest section you have gotten to.

This is the default behavior
